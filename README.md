# Rusting Together Podcast Code Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Rusting Together, a podcast featuring three friends, Eran, Etzik, and Zeev, on a journey to learn the Rust programming language together! This repository contains the source code for the projects we develop during our podcast episodes.
## About the Podcast

Rusting Together is a weekly podcast where we (Eran, Etzik, and Zeev) explore Rust, an increasingly popular systems programming language that prioritizes safety, speed, and concurrency. We will be discussing our progress, sharing our thoughts on various Rust concepts, and working on small projects together. No matter if you are a seasoned Rustacean or just starting out, we hope our experiences will be both entertaining and educational.
